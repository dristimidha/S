## What is Schema Focused Therapy?

Schema Focused Therapy (SFT) is an integrative, evidence-based psychotherapy developed by Dr. Jeffrey Young. It builds upon cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) by incorporating elements from attachment theory, Gestalt therapy, object relations, and constructivism. It's designed to treat personality disorders and chronic psychological problems that haven't responded well to traditional CBT.

The core concept of SFT revolves around **schemas**, which are deeply ingrained, self-defeating patterns that develop in childhood and adolescence. These schemas often stem from unmet core emotional needs, such as the need for secure attachment, autonomy, realistic limits, freedom to express valid needs and emotions, and spontaneity and play.

When these needs aren't met, individuals develop maladaptive schemas, such as:

*   **Abandonment/Instability:** The belief that significant others will leave or be unavailable.
*   **Mistrust/Abuse:** The expectation that others will hurt, abuse, cheat, or take advantage of them.
*   **Emotional Deprivation:** The belief that one's needs for nurturance, empathy, or protection will not be adequately met.
*   **Defectiveness/Shame:** The feeling that one is flawed, bad, or worthless.
*   **Social Isolation/Alienation:** The belief that one is different from others and doesn't belong.

These schemas lead to **coping styles**, which are behavioral patterns used to deal with the pain caused by the schemas. These coping styles can be maladaptive in the long run, reinforcing the schemas and perpetuating a cycle of distress. Common coping styles include:

*   **Schema Surrender:** Giving in to the schema.
*   **Schema Avoidance:** Avoiding situations that trigger the schema.
*   **Schema Overcompensation:** Behaving in a way that is the opposite of the schema.
