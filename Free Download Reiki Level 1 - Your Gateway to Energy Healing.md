## What is Reiki Level 1 All About?

Reiki, a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing, is based on the principle that an unseen ‚Äúlife force energy‚Äù flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's "life force energy" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.

Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery.

Reiki Level 1, also known as *Shoden* in Japanese, is the **entry point** into this beautiful healing modality. It's where you'll learn the foundational principles, history, and techniques that form the basis for all subsequent Reiki levels. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect to learn in a typical Reiki Level 1 course:

*   **The History of Reiki:** Discover the fascinating story of Dr. Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki, and the lineage of masters that have preserved and passed down this sacred knowledge. Understanding the origins of Reiki helps you appreciate its depth and power.
*   **The Five Reiki Principles:** These principles serve as guiding principles for living a more balanced and harmonious life. You'll learn how to integrate these principles into your daily life to enhance your well-being and your ability to channel Reiki energy.

*   **The Reiki Attunement:** The most crucial part of Reiki Level 1 is the attunement. This sacred ceremony is a powerful process where a Reiki Master aligns your energy centers, opening you up to channel Reiki energy. After the attunement, you'll be able to administer Reiki to yourself and others.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Learn about the ethical guidelines that govern Reiki practice, ensuring that you provide safe, responsible, and compassionate healing.
