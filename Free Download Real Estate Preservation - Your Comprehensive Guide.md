## What is Real Estate Preservation and Why Does It Matter?

**Real estate preservation** encompasses a wide range of activities aimed at maintaining the value, structural integrity, and overall appeal of properties. It's not just about cosmetic repairs; it's a proactive approach to managing assets and ensuring long-term profitability. Failing to properly preserve real estate can lead to:

*   **Depreciation in Value:** Neglected properties naturally lose value over time.
*   **Increased Repair Costs:** Minor issues can escalate into major, expensive problems.
*   **Loss of Rental Income:** Unattractive or poorly maintained properties struggle to attract and retain tenants.
*   **Legal Liabilities:** Failure to address safety hazards can lead to lawsuits.
*   **Environmental Concerns:** Improper maintenance can result in environmental damage.

Therefore, understanding the core principles of real estate preservation is crucial for investors, landlords, property managers, and homeowners alike.
