## Deciphering the Minor Arcana: Everyday Life and Practical Matters

While the Major Arcana deals with the grand themes of life, the Minor Arcana focuses on the everyday details, relationships, and practical matters. These 56 cards are divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles.

*   **Cups (Water):** Represents emotions, relationships, intuition, and love. Cups are the heart of the tarot.
*   **Swords (Air):** Represents intellect, communication, conflict, and challenges. Swords signify mental clarity (or the lack thereof).
*   **Pentacles (Earth):** Represents material possessions, security, finances, and the physical world. Pentacles ground you in reality.

The course will help you understand each suit's symbolism and how to interpret the cards within each suit, from the Ace to the Ten, and the court cards (Page, Knight, Queen, and King).
