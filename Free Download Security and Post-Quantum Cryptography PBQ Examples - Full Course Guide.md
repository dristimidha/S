## Why is Security and PBQ Training Important?

The looming threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption algorithms necessitates a proactive approach to cybersecurity. Quantum computers, leveraging quantum mechanics principles, possess the potential to solve complex problems far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. This capability includes cracking commonly used encryption methods, like RSA and ECC, which currently protect sensitive data across the internet.

Learning about security with PBQ, therefore, prepares you for a future where traditional cryptography is rendered obsolete. It empowers you to understand, implement, and safeguard systems against quantum attacks. Acquiring this knowledge now will give you a significant competitive advantage and allow you to contribute meaningfully to building a quantum-resistant digital infrastructure. Furthermore, understanding PBQ is increasingly important for compliance with emerging regulatory standards related to data security and privacy.
